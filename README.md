# matrix-confirmation

## Concept

The goal of this project would be to replace e-mail confirmation by using Matrix instead.  
Not a bridge, a plain old & stupid replacement with API endpoints to authenticate and send verification to users.

Some goals of the project are:

 - Basic bot functions (invite user, create rooms, send messages)
 - Basic API to send messages to specified users
 - Authentication on API endpoints
